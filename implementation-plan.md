- [x] Project setup with React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- [x] Development environment configuration
- [x] Welcome page with kid-friendly design
- [x] Testing infrastructure (Vitest + React Testing Library)
- [x] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [x] Pipeline fixes and successful deployment
- [x] Comprehensive documentation (README + progress tracking)

### ðŸ”„ **Remaining Work**

#### **Step 8: Drawing Canvas Foundation** *(Completed: 2025-08-19)*
**Goal**: Implement HTML5 canvas with touch drawing capability

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Canvas component with proper sizing and scaling
- [x] Touch event handling (finger/stylus input)
- [x] Basic drawing functionality with smooth lines
- [x] Prevent page scrolling during drawing
- [x] Clear canvas functionality
- [x] Canvas state management hooks (useCanvas, useDrawing)
- [x] Drawing page with routing (/draw)
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage for canvas functionality

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
interface CanvasProps {
  width: number;
  height: number;
  onDrawingChange: (dataURL: string) => void;
}

// Touch event handling
const handleTouchStart = (e: TouchEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Prevent scrolling
  const touch = e.touches[0];
  // Start drawing path
};
```

**Testing Criteria:**
- [x] Draws smoothly on mobile Chrome/Safari
- [x] Touch events work without page scrolling  
- [x] Canvas scales properly on different screen sizes
- [x] All unit tests passing (14/14)
- [x] Component properly prevents default touch behavior
- [x] Routing works between home and drawing pages

---

#### **Step 9: Mobile-Native Styling** *(Completed: 2025-08-19)*
**Goal**: Optimize UI for mobile-native appearance and user experience

**Deliverables:**
- [x] Device detection utilities (mobile vs desktop)
- [x] Mobile-specific canvas styling (remove borders, add subtle shadows)
- [x] Responsive layout optimization for mobile devices
- [x] Dynamic canvas sizing based on viewport and orientation
- [x] Streamlined mobile interface (remove redundant elements)
- [x] Comprehensive testing for device detection logic

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Smart device detection
const isMobileDevice = () => {
  const hasTouchScreen = 'ontouchstart' in window || navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0;
  const isMobileUserAgent = /Android|iPhone|iPad|iPod/i.test(navigator.userAgent);
  const isSmallScreen = window.innerWidth <= 768;
  return hasTouchScreen && (isMobileUserAgent || isSmallScreen);
};

// Mobile-specific styling
const canvasClassName = isMobile 
  ? "bg-white touch-none select-none rounded-lg shadow-sm"
  : "border-4 border-primary-200 rounded-2xl bg-white touch-none select-none shadow-lg";
```

**Testing Criteria:**
- [x] Mobile detection works accurately across devices
- [x] Canvas styling adapts properly (borders removed on mobile)
- [x] Layout optimizes for mobile viewport sizes
- [x] Orientation changes handled smoothly
- [x] All tests pass (21/21) including device utilities

#### **Step 10: Drawing Tools UI** *(Next Step)*
**Goal**: Create kid-friendly color picker and brush controls

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Color picker with 6-8 primary colors
- [ ] Brush size controls (small, medium, large)
- [ ] Tool panel with large touch targets (44px minimum)
- [ ] Active tool state indication
- [ ] Kid-friendly button animations and feedback

**Color Palette:**
```typescript
const kidColors = [
  '#FF6B6B', // Red
  '#4ECDC4', // Teal  
  '#45B7D1', // Blue
  '#96CEB4', // Green
  '#FECA57', // Yellow
  '#FF9FF3', // Pink
  '#54A0FF', // Light Blue
  '#5F27CD'  // Purple
];
```

**Testing Criteria:**
- [ ] All buttons meet 44px touch target requirement
- [ ] Color selection provides clear visual feedback
- [ ] Brush size changes are immediately visible

---

#### **Step 10: Local Storage System**
**Goal**: Save and load drawings with thumbnail gallery

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] SavedDrawing interface implementation
- [ ] Save drawing with automatic thumbnail generation
- [ ] Basic gallery component showing saved drawings
- [ ] Load drawing functionality
- [ ] Storage quota management (max 50 drawings)
- [ ] Auto-cleanup of oldest drawings when limit reached

**Storage Interface:**
```typescript
interface SavedDrawing {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  dataURL: string;
  createdAt: string;
  thumbnail: string; // 150x150px version
}

// Storage service
const saveDrawing = (canvas: HTMLCanvasElement, name: string) => {
  const drawing: SavedDrawing = {
    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
    name,
    dataURL: canvas.toDataURL('image/png'),
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    thumbnail: generateThumbnail(canvas)
  };
  
  const drawings = getStoredDrawings();
  drawings.push(drawing);
  
  // Cleanup if over limit
  if (drawings.length > 50) {
    const sorted = drawings.sort((a, b) => 
      new Date(a.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(b.createdAt).getTime()
    );
    localStorage.setItem('kids-drawings', JSON.stringify(sorted.slice(-50)));
  } else {
    localStorage.setItem('kids-drawings', JSON.stringify(drawings));
  }
};
```

**Testing Criteria:**
- [ ] Drawings save reliably to localStorage
- [ ] Gallery loads quickly with thumbnails
- [ ] Storage quota management prevents overflow
- [ ] Saved drawings can be loaded back to canvas
